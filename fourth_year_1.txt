Relational Algebra
 
An overview of the Relational Algebra consisted of eight operators, two groups of four each:
 
1. The traditional set operators union, intersection, difference, and Cartesian product.
 
2. The special relational operators restrict (also known as select), project, join, and divide.
 
Here are simplified definitions of these eight operators
 
Restrict: Returns a relation containing all tuples from a specified relation that satisfy a specified condition.
 
Project: Returns a relation containing all (sub)tuples that remain in a specified relation after specified attributes have been removed.
 
Product: Returns a relation containing all possible tuples that are a combination of two tuples, one from each of two specified relations.
 
Union: Returns a relation containing all tuples that appear in either or both of two specified relations.
 
Intersect: Returns a relation containing all tuples that appear in both of two specified relations.
 
Difference: Returns a relation containing all tuples that appear in the first and not the second of two specified relations.
 
Join: Returns a relation containing all possible tuples that are a combination of two tuples, one from each of two specified relations, such that the two tuples contributing to any given combination have a common value for the common attributes of the two relations.
 
Divide: Takes two unary relations and one binary relation and returns a relation containing all tuples from one unary relation that appear in the binary relation matched with all tuples in the other unary relation.
