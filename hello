Data Structures
Data may be organized in many different ways:the logical or mathematical model of a particular organization of data is called a data structure.
The choice of a particular data model depends on two considerations.First,it must be rich enough in structure to mirror the actual relationships in the real world.
On the other hand,the structure should be simple enough that onc can effectively process of the data when necessary.

Array 
The simplest type of data is called a linear (or one dimension array).

One Dimensional Array
Linear Array are called one dimensional array beacause each element in such an array is referenced by one subscript.

Two Dimensional Array
Two Dimensioan Array is a collection of similar data where each element is referenced by two subscripts.

A linear array consisting of the names of the six students.

Trees
Data frequently contain a hierarchical relationship between various elements.The data structure which reflects this relationship is called a rooted tree graph or,simply
a tree.

Record Structure 
Although a file may be maintained by means of one or more arrays,a record,where one indicates both the group items and the elementary items,can best be described by means
of a tree sturucture.For example,an employee personel record may contain the following data items:
Social Security Number,Name,Address,Age,Salary,Dependents

Consider the Algebraic Expression
(2x+y)(a-7b)^3
There are data sturctures other than arrays,linked lists and trees which we shall study.Some of these sturctures are briefly described below.

Stack
A stack,also called a last-in first-out(LIFO) system,is a linear list in which insertions and deletions can take place only at one end,called the top.

Queue
A queue,also called a first-in first-out(FIFO) system,is a linear list.

Graph
Data sometimes contain a relatiionship between pairs of elements which is not necessarily hierarchical in nature.For example,suppose in airline flies connected by lines.
The data sturcture which reflects this type of relationship is called a graph.
